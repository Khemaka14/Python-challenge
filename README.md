The Pybank Python script takes a dataset containing the loss/profit of a company as well as the date of the transaction and returns a financial analysis. The financial analysis consists of the total months of transactions, the net total of profit/loss, the average change of the profit, greatest increase & decrease in profit. All of these results are exported into a text file as well.

The Pypoll Python script takes a dataset of election results containing Voter ID, county and candidate. The script will then return the election results, containing the total number of votes cast, and all the candidates. As well as the percentages and total number of votes for each one. Finally, it also returns the winner. All of these results are exported into a text file as well.
